# Network-App

This is a simple Network application to read and write files to a single or multiple routers/switches via a SSH interface. it requires a user_file.txt that contains 
password and username information, a cmd_file.txt that contains a list of commands you would like to execute seperated by newlines, and an IP_address.txt that contains a 
list of the addresses to the routers/switches you would like to read/write to. There is also a portion of the code that requires an unique ssh-keygen code generated by 
the user in order to facilitate remote login. the code AUTH_Path_Checker works without a key, but is a HUGE security risk. the
session.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy()) command should be replace with your own unique ssh key in order to avoid this
